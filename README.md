Takeaways from each chapter:
    
    1. Chapter 01 - Vital Python
        -> Standard Math operation 
            => (+, -, *, /, //-> i2nteger division, **-> Exponentiation, %-> Modulo/Remainder)
            => Order of operations
            => Number type  -> Integers and Floats
                            -> Complex number types
            => variables 
                -> Assignment
                -> Reassignment
                -> Variable names / Python Keywords () 
        -> Strings => Concatanations, Methods, Input(), Interpolation, Indexig and Slicing
        -> Boolean => True/False and Conditionals
        -> Loops

    2. Chapter 02 - Python Structures
        -> List => Power of lists, Matrix operations, List Methods
        -> Dictionary => Keys and Values, Dictionary Methods
        -> Tuples => structure def
        -> Sets => survey of sets

    3. Chapter 03 - Execution Python: Programs, Algorithms and Functions
        -> Python scripts and Module
        -> Python Algorithms
        -> Basic Functions
        -> Iterative Functions
        -> Recursive Functions
        -> Dynamic Functions
        -> Helper functions - DRY (don't repeate yourself) principle
        -> Variable scope - namespaces (keywords: "global" and "nonlocal")
        -> Lambda Functions => function = lambda arguments: single expression
                            => mapping with lambda functions: map(func, iter)
                            => filter with lambda functions: filter(func, iter)
                            => sorted with lamda functions: sorted(iter, key)

    4. Chapter 04 - Extending Python: Files, Errors and Graphs
        -> Reading files => with statement
        -> Writing files => close files after writing in them
        -> Assertions => use them as debug tool
        -> Plotting techniques  => matplotlib.pyplot functions
                                => bar, barh, pie charts
                                => heatmaps, density plot, contour plot, 3D plot
                                => Manipulating the Axis (wrong graph, wrong Context)
                                
    5. Chapter 05 - Constructing Python-Classes and Methods
        -> Classes and Objects  => Instance methods, self
                                => positional args vs keyword args(kwarg)
                                => __init__, __str__ methods
                                => inheritance, subclass
                                => the Property Decorator
                                => the setter method
                                => The DRY principle revisited
                                => Sub-classing of a defined class in a standard library
                                => Overriding Methods using super()
                                => Multiple inheritance
